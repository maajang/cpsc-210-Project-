# cpsc-210-Software Construction Project:Restaurant Quiz
Upload will be up soon. 
The Restaurant Quiz application prompts the user to select a category of restaurants or to select from a predetermined list of Canadian cities. 
It then chooses a restaurant from the selected category or city and invites the user to guess the location of the restaurant by clicking on a map. 
The quiz is time-limited. The goal is to click within 50m of the restaurant in as small a number of attempts as possible, within the time allowed.  Just to keep things interesting, the view of the map changes after each guess.
